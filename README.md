# CODELAB-II-ASSESSMENT-2-Data-Driven-Application

Assessment 2: Data Driven Application

The Brief

For this assignment you are tasked with developing an application that makes use of data retrieved from an API. Your application should demonstrate the use functions, and pass arguments between these as appropriate. Where possible, the application should also implement object oriented programming techniques. 
GITHUB:ASSESSMENT 2 - UTILITY APP

The final application should be delivered via a functioning interactive GUI built using Tkinter. This GUI should allow the user to interact via mouse and/or keyboard input.

You are required to use one of the APIs listed below:

●	The Cocktail Database
●	The Sports Database
●	The Audio Database
●	The Meal Database
●	The Movie Database


How you use the chosen API and the functionality you provide within your application is up to you. Making creative use of the API and/or providing the user with a range of options to query the API will likely afford higher marks. You should explore the documentation for each API to see what is possible in order to help select the API you wish to work with. 
As noted above the application should be built using the Tkinter library module. 


Assignment setup

You should use the GitHub assignment repository to keep track of your code as you develop your solution and submit your work to GitHub.

Deliverables

The deliverables for the Data Driven Application are as follows:
 
The Application

The Python code and any supplementary assets (images, sounds, fonts) required to run your data driven application.  

The Development Document 

Your data driven application must be accompanied by a Development Document of 1000 words. This development document should consist of the following elements:

●	Abstract: A short description of your application including which API you have selected. You should also provide a link to your Github repository.
●	Project Plan: Project plan that breaks the project down into key milestones (e.g planning, design, development & testing) and tasks. This plan should allocate the estimated time to complete each of the listed tasks. 
●	Evidence of design: This may include but is not limited to: specification list of your program requirements, Flowchart, Pseudo-Code, Wireframes, UML Data Structure Diagram. A minimum expectation for this section is the inclusion of a wireframe for the design of the GUI.
●	Technical Description & Walkthrough:  In this section you should provide a link to a video which includes a walkthrough of your program running as well as a technical breakdown of your code. This technical breakdown should explain how the key features of your program have been implemented via code. The video technical description & walkthrough contributes to the overall word count. The anticipated length of the video is 3-5 minutes.
●	Testing: Test plan and evidence of testing (e.g. screenshots and/or videos). The minimum expectation for this section is a testing table complete with test cases covering the core functionality of your app. 
●	Critical Reflection: An open and detailed evaluation of your application that notes what is compelling about the work, what could be improved, and what you need to learn to make these improvements.
●	Appendix: A copy of your code should be included in an appendix at the end of your documentation. To provide this simply copy and paste the code from each of your project files (do not provide the code in screenshots).
